00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,293
I thought you were her.

335
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,837
It's all right.

336
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,380
It happens.

337
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,382
Apologies.

338
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,389
[Ok-ju] Hey, wait.

Can I, like, buy you a drink?

So, uh, where are we going?

343
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,582
I mean, are we going to your house?

344
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,168
Mine? [scoffs]

345
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,171
What? You wanna meet my parents?

346
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,630
I just met you.

[both chuckle]

348

My parents are living with me.

00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,555
I know a hotel.

350
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,266
It's a pretty cool place… in Gapyeong.

351
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,143
Not many people know about it.

352
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:23,936
They're like…

353
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,648
kind of like a private club.

354
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,611
What's so special about this hotel?

355
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,571
Just you wait.

356
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,032
I think you're gonna love it.

Yes.

Huh?

375

Normally, you can see
the woods out this window.

And in the morning,
the view from this room is incredible.

Yes.

so many more girls too.

If we don't do what they say,
they'll upload it all.

Upload what exactly?

00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,809
Hello.

504
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:58,936
Open the door.

505
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:00,938
Come on.

506
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,617
Well, look who came to visit me.

507
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,912
The news surprised the hell out of me
when I heard about it.

508
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:21,959
How could something so egregious happen
to the great and professional Mr. Choi?

509
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:27,547
Huh? Wow. Wow, your face is
pretty fucked up. [laughing]

510
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:32,552
It's insane.

511
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,471
[whirring]

512
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,723
[air hissing]

513
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,187
[man] So… what should we do?

514
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:47,109
Seriously, that stupid bitch
really left you totally crippled.

515
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,030
You were born
too handsome of a guy anyway, you know.

516
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,450
You also have better fashion sense
than most people.

517
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,997
This makes you… much more of a badass.

518
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,502
Was it one of our goddamn slaves?

519
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:06,628
[sighs]

520
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,881
No. I would have known her.

521
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,718
I've never seen her before.

522
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,805
Then maybe you should hire
one of the Yanbian and put out a hit.

523
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,473
For one girl?

524
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,226
That's a bit much.

525
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,228
[lighter clicking]

526
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,898
[exhales]

527
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,402
I mean, it's something
you and I can handle.

528
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:34,156
Why do you always have to make things
harder than they should be, huh?

529
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:36,867
Myung-shik.

530
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,464
She took my face.

531
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,466
She took my Lamborghini.

532
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,263
My face and my Lamborghini.

533
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,890
[unsettling music playing]

534
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,016
I know.

535
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:06,063
Yeah, man, I don't know. [scoffs]

536
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,523
It's not like I'm a hit man or anything.

537
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,817
You know that I'm a pharmacist.

538
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,527
It's not my job.

539
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:16,531
I mean, it's not like
it's in my blood to be a brutal murderer.

540
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,201
I'll give you a hundred million.

541
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,704
A hundred million won?

542
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,498
It won't take long.

543
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,291
Two days, max.

544
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:35,926
Yeah, but you're not talking about BDSM.
You're talkin' killing a real girl.

545
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:39,846
Yeah.

546
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:42,891
[Myung-shik] Are we filming it?

547
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,853
Why would we film it?

548
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:51,316
Some people film it overseas.
The films are called the snuff genre.

549
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:53,151
[sighs]

550
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,071
Myung-shik.

551
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,576
[eerie tones echoing]

552
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,245
Do I look like I'm joking?

553
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,375
No.

554
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,129
[gunfire]

555
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:13,922
A little lower.

556
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,556
Gun down.

557
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:23,932
[cocks gun]

558
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,739
What happened to your face?

559
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,787
You've been wandering long enough.

560
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:46,830
Come back.

561
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,458
It's impossible to find your replacement.

562
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,003
That's not why I'm here.

563
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,297
I'm not here to get my job back.

564
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,721
I… need some equipment.

565
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,347
Something untraceable.

566
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:09,060
You remember my friend… Min-hee,
I told you.

567
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:11,897
Ballerina.

568
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,486
Well, she… she died.

569
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,699
She ended her life a few days ago.

570
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:25,869
It's a bit complicated.

571
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,249
So now… I have to help her out.

572
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:39,716
Ok-ju, I…

573
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,886
I don't know
what it is that you need to do,

574
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:45,138
but is this really the only way?

575
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,058
You could report it to the police
and maybe they could help--

576
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,351
[Ok-ju] I have to do it.

577
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,562
I owe her that.

578
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,443
Will you help me, Mun-yeong?

579
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,279
Help me get a gun?

580
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:09,037
[tense music playing]

581
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,834
[vehicle approaching]

582
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:57,669
[music stops]

583
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,130
You?

584
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,132
What?

585
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,801
Are you the one
who wanted to buy from us, hmm?

586
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:05,719
Um,

587
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:07,929
yeah.

588
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,681
Hmm. So…

589
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:12,642
Uh, just one minute.

590
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,479
[man] Whoa. Take a look at that fancy car.

591
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,648
That thing is… it's just…

592
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,525
-So fire.
-Yeah.

593
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:24,195
Por… porchay… por…
Is that a new release or…

594
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:33,621
[blows]

595
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,170
Follow me.

596
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,017
[whimsical music playing]

597
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,325
So, um, fire, huh?

598
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,827
Hold it. Come on, don't be shy.

599
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,871
You better feel it for yourself. Hmm?

600
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,249
-A bit heavy?
-[sighs]

601
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,710
Is this all you have?

602
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,883
This one won't even load.

603
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,344
Every gun can be loaded, seriously.

604
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,514
You're just bad at it, for heaven's sake.

605
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,601
-Oil dried up or what? What the heck?
-[gun clicking]

606
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,685
Stupid piece of…

607
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:40,605
This one's busted.

608
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,316
-Gosh dang it. [sucks teeth]
-[guns clatter]

609
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:44,984
Just pick another one.

610
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,613
[riffling through guns]

611
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:50,698
Hey, mister.

612
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,410
Do you have <i>anything </i>decent?

613
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,912
Who uses revolvers anymore?

614
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:58,998
Well, they've all been saying
retro's coming back or something…

615
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,294
[Ok-ju] What's this?

616
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,338
Is this a toy gun?

617
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,007
What do you mean by "toy gun"?

618
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,593
Where's your appreciation for classics?

619
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:14,097
This gun will be your best bud
when you're caught in a pickle.

620
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,515
See it?

621
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:19,477
I bet you can't.
Someone puts a gun to your head.

622
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:22,397
"Ah shit." They ask,
"What's your last wish?"

623
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,691
"One last smoke?" "Smoke away."

624
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,484
You reach for a cigarette and…

625
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,486
Bang! Bang!

626
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,989
Sean Connery. You know that guy?

627
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:32,699
He carries this a lot.

628
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:38,204
This is not just a simple toy.
Just leave it here.

629
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,205
[woman] Hey!

630
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:42,500
What are you using it for?
Tell us about that.

631
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,920
-[Ok-ju] What's it for?
-Mm-hmm.

632
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,298
I guess…

633
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,259
I guess I'll be hunting.

634
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:52,886
[woman] Hunting?

635
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,306
[man] Uh-oh.

636
00:57:56,389 --> 00:58:00,810
[woman sighs] This baby right… here.

637
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,563
Its purpose is
destroying wasp nests. Here.

638
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,317
Watch this. Shoo, shoo! Move away.

[clicks]

640
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,591
Ah yeah.

641
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,926
Pretty sick, huh?

642
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,015
[man] Sir, yes, sir! I love you, sir!

643
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,351
Have you been well?

644
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,229
I've been doing well.
I mean, I can't complain.

645
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,647
Hey, listen, Detective Kim,

646
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,815
you've been a big help
in bringing me money.

647
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:52,946
Ah. I'm calling
because I need help finding a car.

648
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,531
Not a burner car.

649
00:58:56,658 --> 00:59:00,662
It's 19U 9322.

650
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,956
A Lamborghini.
Can you say that back to me?

651
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,876
All right. By the way, why don't you, uh,

652
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,379
stop by our pharmacy?

653
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,464
We've been stocking up on what you like.

654
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,176
[laughing]

655
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,888
Oh, you and your humor, Detective, huh?

656
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:24,811
Ah. You are too much for me,
Detective Kim! Huh?

657
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:25,979
[laughs]

658
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,731
I'll be waiting for your call.

659
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:32,777
[sighs]

660
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:36,573
Why's he wasting time
washing the car right now, huh?

661
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:39,117
He's probably a sociopath.
Seriously. Shit.

662
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,703
-[knocking at window]
-Huh?

663

W-what?

00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,252
-What is it?
-Come over here.

665
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:52,463
Look down there.

666
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,305
